# MLB-Player-Statistic-Predictor

Predictive analytics has become a major player in professional sports.  While most sports are successfully using analytics, the sport that has seen the greatest impact has been baseball.  Baseball has always been a sport that revolved around statistics, so it was only a matter of time before predictive analytics took over.  In this project, we harness the power of machine learning to predict player statistics for the Major League Baseball team, the San Diego Padres.  While leagues, teams, and outside organizations all have their own predictive modeling algorithms, this study uses linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict player statistics for the 2021 season.  The predicted statistics were then fed into an artificial neural network that predicted the chances of the Padres making the MLB playoffs.
